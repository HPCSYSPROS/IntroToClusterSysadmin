Notes:

This needs to happen AFTER the ohpc package installation, since /opt/ohpc/pub doesn't exist yet!

yum install -y nfs-utils mountd rpc-bind 

#for lmod-ohpc
echo "/opt/ohpc/pub 192.168.122.0/24(rw,root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl restart nfs-server

#establish headnode as a timeserver
echo "allow all 192.168.122.0/24" >> /etc/ntpd.conf

#Next, set compute nodes to sync with the headnode
echo "server 192.168.122.1" >> /netboot/centos8/x86_64/compute/rootimg/etc/ntpd.conf

#Now, have the compute nodes mount /opt/ohpc/pub in their fstab
#insert
"maadmin:/opt/ohpc/pub/  /opt/ohpc/pub  nfs   rw  0 0" 
into 
/opt/xcat/share/xcat/netboot/centos/compute.centos7.postinstall
in the fstab generation section
 - seems like /home should be here too; why is that happening?
